# Rabobank Transaction App

This is the frontend for the backend transaction API.

To run the application make sure the Backend is running and `npm install` is executed.

Serve the application by running `npm start`.

I have made a small adjustment to the backend adding CORS.

To run the unit tests run `npm test`.
